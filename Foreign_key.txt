Foreign Key: It is an attribute that we can store on a database table that links to another database table.
It stores the primary key of a row of another database table.

Eg: 

                                        _________>the column name is getting referenced 
                                       |
                                       |
FOREIGN KEY (band_id) REFERENCES bands(id);
                |                   |___________> other table name 
                |                       
        this is the local key which is a foreign key
